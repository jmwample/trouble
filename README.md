# I knew you were trouble

---

This was originally a part of a priviledge escalation in a prank. A friend 
exposed his SSH private key, and through a process I was able to access his
computer AFTER consulting the owner of the machine and getting 
express permission. This set of scripts involves escalating to root then
creating persistence mechanisms to obfuscate the intrusion. It also
includes some pretty glaring pranks that are triggered once an attempt
to remove the scripts is detected.

### Disclaimer

I DO NOT permit any use of these scripts to subvert security on a computer system that 
you do not own or do not have permision to access. I do not recommend 
attempting priviledge escalations on any machines other than personally owned devices,
nor do I condone unlawful access of computer systems. I had permission from
the owner of the machine ( our mentor ) before using this tool to access the 
remote machine. Please pank responsibly, and if you cannot do so, please write
your own stuff.
